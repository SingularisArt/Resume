\tagline{
  Amazing tag line that makes HR managers want to hire you
  immediately.

  The tag line is aligned with the bottom of the picture to the
  right, so if you have

  multiple lines it fills the space to your name from
  the bottom. You might want to

  introduce manual line breaks to make this look
  nicer then simply filling up the lines.
