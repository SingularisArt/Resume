\section{Another section}

This page uses the page style \texttt{highlightmain} which shows the highlight bar (gray) and the main part (white background) but omits the header. 
The default page style is \texttt{headerhighlightmain} with all three elements.
If you don't want header, nor highlight bar, use page style \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}}.
\medskip
Neither main, nor highlight bar must be filled to make this template work.
It is possible to use a page style with the highlight bar but leave it empty by setting an empty highlightbar \texttt{\textbackslash highlightbar\{\}}.
